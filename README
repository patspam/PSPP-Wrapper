PSPP::Wrapper - Wrapper for the pspp command-line interface

PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. 
It is a Free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very similar to it with a few exceptions.
PSPP is particularly aimed at statisticians, social scientists and students requiring fast convenient analysis of sampled data.

For more information, see http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp

Please note, this module is just a simple wrapper around the pspp command-line infterface. 
For a module that actually groks PSPP and hence allows you to read/write 
PSPP and/or SPSS native files, see the PSPP module on CPAN.

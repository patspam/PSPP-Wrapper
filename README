PSPP - Perl library for interacting with PSPP

PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. 
It is a Free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very similar to it with a few exceptions.
PSPP is particularly aimed at statisticians, social scientists and students requiring fast convenient analysis of sampled data.
